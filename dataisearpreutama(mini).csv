joy,on days when i feel close to my partner and other friends when i feel at peace with myself and also experience a close contact with people whom i regard greatly
fear,every time i imagine that someone i love or i could contact a serious illness even death
anger,when i had been obviously unjustly treated and had no possibility of elucidating this
sadness,when i think about the short time that we live and relate it to the periods of my life when i think that i did not use this short time
disgust,at a gathering i found myself involuntarily sitting next to two people who expressed opinions that i considered very low and discriminating
shame,when i realized that i was directing the feelings of discontent with myself at my partner and this way was trying to put the blame on him instead of sorting out my own feeliings
guilt,i feel guilty when when i realize that i consider material things more important than caring for my relatives i feel very selfcentered
joy,after my girlfriend had taken her exam we went to her parents place
fear,when for the first time i realized the meaning of death
anger,when a car is overtaking another and i am forced to drive off the road
sadness,when i recently thought about the hard work it takes to study and how one wants to try something else when i read a theoretical book in english that i did not understand
disgust,when i found a bristle in the liver paste tube
shame,when i was tired and unmotivated i shouted at my girlfriend and and brought up negative sides of her character which are actually not so important
guilt,when i think that i do not study enough after the weekend i think that i should have been able to have accomplished something during that time
joy,when i pass an examination which i did not think i did well
